//! Rust-based hooks for running alongside SQL migrations.
//! These are interleaved with SQL-based migrations from the top-level
//! `migrations` folder.
//!
//! When writing these hooks, only use dynamic sqlx queries - since
//! the schema might change in the future, but queries in here should never
//! change.
//!
//! Note that these don't behave like SQL migrations: they are not checksummed,
//! we never record whether a hook has run, and don't check for previously run
//! hooks that are now missing.
