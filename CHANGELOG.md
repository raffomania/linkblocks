This is the initial release of linkblocks!

### Features

- linkblocks users can be followed from Mastodon. Any bookmark added to a public list is considered public and will show up in the timeline.
- linkblocks user handles can now be looked up via webfinger. This should work on most fediverse platforms, and was tested with Lemmy.
- The new user profile page shows all public lists of a user.
- Single-sign-on: Users can register and log in via OIDC.
- Bookmarklet for one-click adding of new bookmarks.
- Deployed as a single binary, with PostgreSQL as the only dependency.
