# linkblocks Changelog

## Unreleased

### Internals

- Update all dependencies.

## 0.1.0

_Released on 2025-11-23_

This is the initial release of linkblocks!
A lot of groundwork has been laid for federating with other services, and posting bookmarks to Mastodon is the first fruit of that labor available with this release. For an example, check out [rafael@lb.rafa.ee](https://mstdn.io/@rafael@lb.rafa.ee), or try it with [the linkblocks demo](https://linkblocks.rafa.ee).

linkblocks is now quite stable, and I've been using it for myself for over a year.
Of course there are still some rough edges, and tons of features I'd like to add, so watch this space!

### Features

- Post bookmarks to Mastodon: any bookmark added to a public list is considered public and will show up in the timeline.
- Look up linkblocks user handles via webfinger. This should work on most fediverse platforms, and was tested with Lemmy.
- See all public lists of a user on the new profile page.
- Organize bookmarks using lists with arbitrary nesting.
- Single-sign-on: Register and log in via OIDC.
- Add new bookmarks with a single click using the bookmarklet.
- Deploy it as a single binary, with PostgreSQL as the only dependency.
