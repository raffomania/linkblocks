# Writing Migrations

Linkblocks uses a custom migration system that wraps the migration runner from the sqlx crate.
This allows us to run arbitrary rust code before and after the SQL part of a migration, within the same transaction.

However, it means that the rust code in the project needs to compile successfully so you can run the migrations.
Because we use sqlx, this means that the database must match the schema the queries in the rust code expect.

When adding a new migration, follow these steps:

1. Create the migration using `sqlx migrate add`.
1. Write your migration code.
1. Migrate the database using `just migrate-database`.
1. Optional: Run `just generate-database-info` so you can compile with `SQLX_OFFLINE=true`, if needed.
1. Any queries conflicting with the new database schema will now cause compilation to fail. Update these to make the code compile again.
