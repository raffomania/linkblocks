# Search

Design document for full-text search through

- bookmark titles
- content of bookmarked html websites
- list titles
- list descriptions (called "content" in the code)

## Requirements

- No extra service to deploy
- Up to a certain size, search should take <500ms and be a lot faster for small datasets
- Index size should be reasonable, e.g. not more than 2x of original content
- target: 50 users per instance with 50k bookmarks each should be easy for hosters
- need to return matched positions for highlighting them in search results
- should support language-aware stemming
- Should have a "good" way to rank results

## "Good" Ranking

- Should some level of fuzziness be involved?
- Weight matches in the bookmark title higher than website content
- BM25 is a good baseline

## PostgreSQL full-text-search

- Seems like the ranking functions `ts_rank` and `ts_rank_cd` have pretty heavy performance impact, although for the size of linkblocks this might not be a problem
- No BM25 ranking, but it can at least normalize word frequency by document length
- tsvectors can only take a limited number of lexeme positions (but an unlimited number of lexemes?)
- Can rank different parts of the tsvector differently (title, body)
- quicker to implement than Tantivy
- Let's evaluate how good the ranking actually is

## Tantivy

- Uses BM25 for ranking
- Ranking is faster than with Postgres
- Extra implementation complexity if indexes are cached on disk, or extra memory & compute required if they are stored in-memory
    - Check the indexing performance & space requirements
- For on-disk storage, needs extra work to robustly handle file corruption, recovery from bugs, etc.
    - Alternatively: store indexes in postgres

## pg_search

- Implements BM25 and more in postgres using tantivy
- [Requires custom postgres installation](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/main/pg_search#installation)
